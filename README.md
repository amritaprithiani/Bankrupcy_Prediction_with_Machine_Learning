## Project Description / Outline

Predicting Bankruptcy involves examining various financial performance measures of financially distressed firms.

This process is important for financial institutions and investors as they evaluate performance and make predictions to manage lending risks.

This project uses financial data NASDAQ and incorporates machine learning classification algorithms to determine bankruptcy predictions.

## Research Questions to Answer

- Predict if company will go bankrupt within a given period of time based on data gathered.

## Datasets to be used

- [American Bankruptcy Dataset](https://github.com/sowide/bankruptcy_dataset)
- [Bankruptcy American Dataset](Resources/american_bankruptcy_dataset)

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks

1. Acquire data set
2. Confirm that data source can be used
3. Clean and manipulate data as needed
4. Determine proper machine learning algorithm to make prediction
5. What machine learning we will use?
- SVM
- Ada Boost
- Others (XGBoost, etc.)

Compare results with calculated financial ratios
Draw conclusions and lessons learned
